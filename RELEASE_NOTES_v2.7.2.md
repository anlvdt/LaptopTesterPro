## ✨ Major Changes

### 🔧 Critical Bug Fixes

#### Issue 1: Missing Report Details (14 of 16 Steps)

**Problem:** When user completed all 16 tests, final report only showed results from 2 steps (HardwareFingerprintStep and LicenseCheckStep). Other 14 steps had no recorded results.

**Root Cause:** 
- Only 2 Step classes called `record_result()` to store test results
- Other 14 Step classes had `mark_completed()` methods but results weren't being stored
- Dictionary key mismatch: results stored with one key, report lookup used different key

**Solution Implemented:**
```python
# 1. Added step_key constant to ALL 16 Step classes
class MyTestStep(BaseStepFrame):
    def __init__(self, master, **kwargs):
        kwargs["step_key"] = "my_test"  # Fixed constant!
        ...

# 2. Updated mark_completed() and mark_skipped() to use step_key
key_to_use = getattr(self, 'step_key', self.title)
self.record_result(key_to_use, result_data)  # Use step_key, not title!

# 3. Updated record_result() to store by step_key
self.all_results[key] = result_data  # Where key = step_key

# 4. Updated create_simple_summary() to lookup by step_key constants
categories = ["hardware_fingerprint", "license_check", "system_info", ...]
```

**Result:** ✅ All 16 test steps now correctly record and display results

#### Issue 2: License Check Shows "không rõ"

**Problem:** License field in final report displayed "không rõ" instead of actual license status (e.g., "Genuine", "Not Activated").

**Root Cause:**
- Lambda closure captured wrong reference (changed by loop)
- Dictionary key mismatch (stored with translated key, looked up with different key)

**Solution Implemented:**
```python
# Fix 1: Capture result_data by value, not reference
lambda rd=result_data: self.scroll_top_button()  # Default parameter captures value!

# Fix 2: Use step_key constant for storage/lookup
kwargs["step_key"] = "license_check"  # Fixed constant
```

**Result:** ✅ License status now displays correct values

#### Issue 3: Missing Assets in Build

**Problem:** Standalone executable was missing logo and stereo_test.mp3 audio file.

**Root Cause:** PyInstaller `--add-data` argument was missing from build script.

**Solution Implemented:**
```python
# Added to build_simple_fast.py PyInstaller arguments:
'--add-data=assets;assets'  # Include assets folder
```

**Result:** ✅ Portable executable now includes all assets (79.3 MB)

#### Issue 4: Scroll Navigation Unreliable

**Problem:** Jump buttons (▲ ▼) for quick navigation sometimes not visible or not working.

**Root Cause:** CustomTkinter CTkScrollableFrame internal canvas access unreliable.

**Solution Implemented:**
```python
# Enhanced _create_scroll_buttons() with:
- Multiple scroll detection methods (_canvas, _parent_canvas)
- update_idletasks() for proper timing
- Exception handling with fallback timing
- Debug logging for troubleshooting
```

**Result:** ⚠️ Significantly improved (some edge cases may remain - CustomTkinter limitation)

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Architecture: step_key System

The fundamental issue with v2.7.0 was that results were being stored with translated step names as dictionary keys:

```python
# v2.7.0 - WRONG ❌
title = get_text("battery_health")  # Could be "Kiểm tra Pin" or "Battery Health"
self.all_results[title] = result  # Key changes with language!
```

This meant:
- If you ran in Vietnamese, key = "Kiểm tra Pin"
- If you switched to English, key = "Battery Health"
- When displaying report in English, lookup fails because previous results stored under Vietnamese key

**v2.7.2 Solution:**

```python
# v2.7.2 - CORRECT ✅
kwargs["step_key"] = "battery_health"  # Fixed constant, never changes!
self.all_results[step_key] = result    # Always "battery_health"
```

Now:
- Results always stored with fixed constant key
- Language switch doesn't affect lookups
- Report generation uses same fixed keys
- Future database/export features won't break

### Code Changes Summary

**File: main_enhanced_auto.py**

1. **BaseStepFrame.__init__()** - Added step_key support to all steps
2. **mark_completed()** - Updated to use step_key when calling record_result()
3. **mark_skipped()** - Updated to use step_key when calling record_result()
4. **record_result()** - Updated to store by step_key
5. **create_simple_summary()** - Updated categories to use step_key constants
6. **All 16 Step Classes** - Added `kwargs["step_key"] = "..."` in __init__()
7. **LicenseCheckStep** - Added Lambda closure fix

**File: build_simple_fast.py**

1. Added `'--add-data=assets;assets'` to PyInstaller arguments
