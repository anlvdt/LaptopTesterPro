# 🛒 Feature: Auto-Open Affiliate Link on Exit

## Version 2.7.2 - 15/10/2025

---

## ✅ What's New

**Feature:** When user exits the application (click X button or exit button), automatically open Shopee affiliate link in browser to increase traffic and potential conversions.

**Link:** https://s.shopee.vn/7AUkbxe8uu

---

## 🎯 Purpose

### Marketing & Monetization:
- 💰 Increase affiliate revenue
- 📈 Drive traffic to Shopee store
- 🎯 100% visibility for all users exiting app
- 🛒 Create additional conversion opportunity

### User Behavior:
- Users have just finished using the app
- Good timing to suggest products/services
- Non-intrusive: opens in new tab, not popup

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Modified:
- `main_enhanced_auto.py` (Method: `quit_app`)

### Code Changes:

**Before:**
```python
def quit_app(self):
    self.clear_window()
    self.destroy()
```

**After:**
```python
def quit_app(self):
    """Quit application and open affiliate link"""
    try:
        # Open Shopee affiliate link before closing
        webbrowser.open("https://s.shopee.vn/7AUkbxe8uu")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Could not open affiliate link: {e}")
    finally:
        # Always close the app even if link fails to open
        self.clear_window()
        self.destroy()
```

### Key Features:

1. **Error Handling:**
   - Try-except block catches any browser opening errors
   - App always closes successfully (finally block)

2. **Non-Blocking:**
   - `webbrowser.open()` returns immediately
   - Doesn't wait for browser to load
   - App closes without delay

3. **Already Connected:**
   - X button already triggers `quit_app()` via:
   - `self.protocol("WM_DELETE_WINDOW", self.quit_app)`
